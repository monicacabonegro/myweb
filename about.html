                        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi I'm Monica Cabonegro and 20 years old. I was  born on 
                            August 27, 2003. I live in Brgy. Monbon,  Sta.Margarita, Samar. 
                            I studied in NorthWest Samar State University. I am 2nd year
                            student
                            with the course Bachelor of Science in  Information

                            In my life describing myself is

                              to do 
                            but it's fascinating too. To put it in words, 
                            I would describe myself as a  kind, generous, and helpful person. 
                            I love to help my

                            is all about and what it holds in the future.</p>
