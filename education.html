                    <h1>Educational Background</h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Education is a learning experience from which people gain knowledge. 
                        Education can come in all form, as we can learn essential information and life skills at anytime and anywhere. 
                        In my 2 years in college I enrolled in the course Bachelor of Science in Information System at NorthWest Samar State University.
                        For me as a student its not easy to take this course because this is not the course that I want to enrolled.
                        But in the past years that I am in this course I realized that this course is in demand now a days and I got some new friends.
                        Also I got a certificate of being an student officer in first year.
                        In my achievements I didn't got some certificates or honors but my greatest achievement of being a student is I entered college. 
                        I achieve now a certificate for being a officer in Information System Organization (ISO). </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="educ1">
                    <h1>Educational Journey</h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my high school I am that student always active on schools and also to be learn. 
                        I had the opportunity to explore new topic, meet new people and developed new skills. 
                        One of the most significant changes I experience during my junior high school years with the strand of Computer system servicing.
                        This allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of these subject and prepare for the more advanced coursework .
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I entered college with the new look in life with a new found love for knowledge.
                        The college days are genuinely surprising and a wonderful point in life where we take mature steps 
                        towards our future, meeting many friends, choosing our majors, finalizing our careers, and preparing for the challenges as a student. 
                        I enrolled Bachelor of Science in Information system this course is not easy to learn for me but I'm still studying and take more knowledge like coding HTML, 
                        JavaScript and CSS I experience how to code in the laboratory with the deeper understanding. 
                        I developed my communication to approach others for asking them. 
                        This challenges is just a reason for making me a better student. 
                        Lastly, this course would be the best in the future.</p>
